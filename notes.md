# Nvidia GpuGems3 Chapter 31

## Introduction

- good introduction for presentation ("The all-pairs approach to N-body simulation is a brute-force technique that evaluates all pair-wise interactions among the N bodies. It is a relatively simple method, but one that is not generally used on its own in the simulation of large systems because of its O(NÂ²) computational complexity")

- close-range vs longe-range (all-pairs vs far-field approximation)

- Algorithms: Barnes-Hut method (BH - 1986), fast multipole method (FMM - 1987), particle-mesh methods (1981/1993)

- all-pairs part important to accelerate because substantial time to compute


## Performacen Results

- "Fortunately, the N-body code has several instances where MAD instructions are generated by the compiler,.." 
so these are already generated by the compiler and do not have to be written by hand
